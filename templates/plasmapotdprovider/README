Plasma Picture-Of-The-Day Provider
----------------------------------

-- Note --

Remember that this potd plugin relies on a semi-public API,
as exposed by the "plasma/potdprovider/potdprovider.h" header.
While this API has been the same for some time, there is no guarantee
that it will be stable for all future versions of the potd dataengine
as part of Plasma Addons.

The main purpose of having this interface semi-public is to allow everyone
to easily develop adapters to more potd providers,
without needing to work directly in the module kdeplasma-addons.

Once your potd plugin is nicely working, please consider to propose it
for inclusion with in the KDE module kdeplasma-addons with the existing potd providers.


-- Build instructions --

cd /where/your/potdprovider/is/generated
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=MYPREFIX ..
make
make install

(MYPREFIX is where you install your Plasma setup, replace it accordingly)
